== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* If no interprocess communication is required use `LocalBroadcastManager` to send and receive broadcasts.
* Specify required permissions to limit the applications that can send broadcasts to your application.
* Treat broadcasts as untrusted and potentially malicious.
