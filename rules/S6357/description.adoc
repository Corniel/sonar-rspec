Android applications can receive broadcasts from the system or other applications (interprocess communication).
Receivers can be declared in the manifest or in the code to make them context specific.

If the receiver is declared in the manifest Android will start the application if it is not already running once a matching broadcast is received.
The receiver is an entry point into the application.

Other applications can send potentially malicious broadcasts, so it is important to consider broadcasts as untrusted and to limit the applications that can send broadcasts to the receiver.

Permissions can be specified to restrict broadcasts to authorized applications. Restrictions can be enforced by both the sender and receiver of a broadcast.
If permissions are specified when registering a broadcast receiver, then only broadcasters who were granted this permission can send a message to the receiver.
