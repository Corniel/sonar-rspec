==== Scenario 1: Risk of vandalism on the front-end website

The malicious link defaces the target web application from the perspective of
the user who is the victim. This may result in loss of integrity and theft of
the benevolent user's data.

==== Scenario 2: Identity spoofing risk.
The malicious link injects malicious code into the web application.
The code enables identity spoofing thanks to cookie theft.

==== Scenario 3: High severity risks.
Depending on the code base affected, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can
have fatal consequences for the underlying enterprise. +
In cases where the malicious link injects malicious code into the web
application, the payloads can:

* enable the theft of locally stored information through various techniques (e.g., keylogging)
* exploit other known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the code base, such as cross-site request forgeries.

XSS are regularly exploited by bug hunters and attackers and coupled with other
bugs to maximize their impact (see {bugbountyxss}[Chained DOM-based XSS] example).
